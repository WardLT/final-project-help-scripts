# Pixels or Points?

[Recent machine learning models](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/machine-learning-masters-molecules/3009010.article)
have shown that it is possible to learn molecular properties from 2D images of molecules. 
These models are fast, simple, and accurate but could we do better if we replace pixels and discrete convolutions with atoms and continuous convolutions?
When is the additional complexity involved in continuous convolutions worthwhile?
