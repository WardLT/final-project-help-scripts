# 2D, or not 2D

Many machine learning models that use the coordinates of molecules to predict their properties are tested with geometries produced using DFT. 
The problem is that these geometries take a long time to compute.
Here, we explore if cheap-to-acquire, 2D coordinates are a suitable replacement.
