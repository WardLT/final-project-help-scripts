# Help Scripts for the Final Project

This repository is an assembly of scripts designed to help students with final projects in "Applied AI for Materials Engineering."
See [applied-ai-for-materials](https://github.com/wardlt/applied-ai-for-materials/) for the notebooks associated with course modules.

## Installation

The notebooks here use the same environment from the teaching modules, unless otherwise noted.
